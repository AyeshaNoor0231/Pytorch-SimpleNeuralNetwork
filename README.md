**About Iris dataset**

**Introduction:**
-Created by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936.
-Widely used in machine learning and statistics.

-Contains measurements from 150 iris flowers.
-Three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
-Each species has 50 samples.

**Features:**
-Four measured features for each flower: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
-All measurements are in centimeters.

**Key components and processes in the framework of a neural network:**

Input Layer: Receives the initial data or features for the neural network.
Hidden Layers: Intermediate layers between the input and output layers. Each layer contains neurons that process information.
Output Layer: Produces the final results or predictions based on the processed information from hidden layers.

Forward Propagation: Process of passing input data through the network to generate an output.
Backward Propagation: Involves the calculation of gradients to update weights and biases during training.
Minimizes the difference between predicted and actual output.

Weights: Parameters that the neural network learns during training. Adjusted during backpropagation to improve model accuracy.
Loss: Measure of the difference between predicted and actual output. Should be low.
Optimizer: Algorithm that adjusts weights and biases based on gradients. Aims to minimize the loss function and enhance model performance.

This framework illustrates the flow of information through a neural network during both forward and backward passes, emphasizing the role of weights, loss, and optimization in the learning process.
